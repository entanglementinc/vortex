INTRODUCTION, vortex is a symetric cipher which encrypts information completely using prime numbers similar to the asymetric bloom cipher by entanglement incorporated.


OVERVIEW, the discrete logarithm is used to encrypt information while exponentiation by squaring is used to decrypt information this a basic cipher which may form a security stable enough for private, corporate and or government nature.

PROCEDURE, each byte is encrypted using a microkey which is composed of two prime number. A microkey is subordiate to the primary key which a unique byte of information to encrypt seperate information in a stream.

CONCLUSION, vortex is a  symetric cipher and is possibly secure for private, corporate and or governement usage allowed further investigation and research of the security of vortex is correct.
