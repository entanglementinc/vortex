<h1>ToyCrypter (with very SMALL key pair) -  This should show you the
applet</h1>

(You have to enable Java in your browser for this.)

<APPLET codebase="."
        code="ToyCrypter.class"
  width="90%" height="90%"
  >
</APPLET><BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> this works in both directions here, because the <em>SECRET KEY</em> is
        included in the <tt>*.class</tt> file (for this toy keypair).
If you want to put something like this on your webpage, of course you have to create the CrytoModule.class <em>without</em> containing your actual secret key!
