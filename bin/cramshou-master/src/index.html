<h1>UserCrypter - This should show you the applet</h1>

(You have to enable Java in your browser for this.)

<APPLET codebase="."
        code="Crypter.class"
  width="90%" height="90%"
  >
</APPLET><BR><BR>
Note: this works in both directions here, because the SECRET KEY is included in the *.class file (for this toy).
If you want to put something like this on your webpage, of course you have to
        create the CrytoModule.class <em>without</em> containing your actual
        secret key!

For this, see folder <tt>./Public/</tt>.
