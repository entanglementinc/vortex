<h1>PublicCrypter - This should show you the applet [./Publish]</h1>

(You have to enable Java in your browser for this.)

Note: Here only the <em>encryption</em> works, since the secret key is NOT
        included (in <tt>CrytoModule.class</tt>). 

This is the way you want it, if you put it on your webpage: Everybody can
encrypt.
But only you, with your personal copy (containing the secret key) can decrypt
again.<br>

See <A HREF="./encrypt-with-forms.html">Here</A> for a version that uses forms.
