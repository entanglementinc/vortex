The 'our' directory contains our implementation and the 'ref' directory, the reference ones.

There are some scripts here. First run './build' to get all the executables. You can then run './bench' for benchmarks, './makeHashes' for hash samples or './makeIntermediate' for intermediate values.

The intermediate values are stored into the 'intermediates' file. The hash samples are the hashes of 0-filled strings which can been used for testing. They are found in the 'zeroHashes' file.

When you are done, you can safely run './mrclean'.

Sorry, no Makefile was done here, due to the structure (with symlinks).
