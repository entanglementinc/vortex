=== Version selection ===

There are three versions of the code:
 * optimized (default)
 * plain
 * intermediate

The first one is the fastest of them. The 'rfsb.c' and 'genmatrix.c' files in the current repository are copies of the optimized versions. The second one is intended to help comprehension of the algorithm. The 
last one prints the intermediate states.

=== Compiling ===

Just run:

$ make


=== Executing ===

For hashing a file:

$ ./rfsb file

or, for hashing from stdin:

$ ./rfsb


=== Plain sources ===

The files in the 'plain' repertory are simplified and non architecture optimized versions of sfsb.c and genmatrix.c. More explanations in the comments. There is also what you need to compile:

$ make
