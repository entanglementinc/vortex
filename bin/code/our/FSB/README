=== Version selection ===

There are three versions of the code:
 * optimized (default)
 * plain
 * intermediate

The first one is the fastest of them. The 'fsb.c' and 'genmatrix.c' files in the current repository are copies of the optimized versions. The second one is intended to help comprehension of the algorithm. The 
last one prints the intermediate states.

=== Compiling ===

$ ./configure HASHLEN
$ make

With:
 * HASHLEN = 160, 224, 256, 384, 512.


=== Executing ===

For hashing a file:

$ ./fsb file

or, for hashing from stdin:

$ ./fsb
